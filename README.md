# Les nouveaux espaces de la notation musicale

This repository contains the web site of a working group on music notation and representation, which was supported by the [AFIM](http://www.afim-asso.org/) (Association Francophone d'Informatique Musicale).  
The work of this group led to the creation of the [TENOR conference](https://www.tenor-conference.org/).
